Bryntum Gantt is a successor of our Ext Gantt product built on the modern web technologies stack.
For its scheduling logic, it uses [ChronoGraph](https://github.com/bryntum/chronograph) - an open source reactive computational engine,
which provides excellent performance and support for projects of any size.

Bryntum Gantt supports:

* Scheduling tasks using dependencies
* Scheduling tasks using constraints
* Calendars for project, tasks and resources
* Both recurrent and fixed time intervals for calendars
* Very customizable rendering and styling
* Rich graphical UI, including many different column types & task editor
* Support for huge projects. Project size is limited only by the memory.
* Lots more - please refer to our guides and [API docs](#Gantt/view/Gantt).

The scheduling engine used by the Bryntum Gantt is very customizable and you can extend it with your own business logic. You can also use our
[Professional Services](https://www.bryntum.com/services/) if you need fine tuning of the scheduling logic to suit your needs.

## Framework agnostic

The Bryntum Gantt is written in ECMAScript 2020 using modern web technologies. It does not require any framework and integrates easily
with popular frameworks such as React, Angular and Vue. It ships with demos for React, Vue, and all versions of Angular.

## Getting started

For getting started information, please refer to [this guide](#guides/getting_started.md).


## External dependencies

Bryntum Gantt has just one external dependency - ChronoGraph. If you use the bundle version, it's built in and should require no extra installation or configuration.
