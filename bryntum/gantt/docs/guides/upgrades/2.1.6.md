# What's new in Gantt v2.1.6

## Angular, React and Vue `ganttEngine` has been renamed to `ganttInstance`

To avoid confusing the calculating engine with the instance of Bryntum Gantt, `ganttEngine` has been renamed to `ganttInstance`. The change is backwards compatible hence applications using `ganttEngine` will still work, but with deprecation warning in the console.

Change all occurrences of `ganttEngine` to `ganttInstance` in your Angular, React or Vue application to get rid of the warning and to make the application consistent with Bryntum Gantt wrapper naming.
