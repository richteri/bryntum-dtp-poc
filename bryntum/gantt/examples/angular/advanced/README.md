## Start development server

To start development server run: 

```
npm install
npm start
``` 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build example

To build example run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

 The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Troubleshooting

In the case of compile error (`npm run build` or `npm start` fails) try to delete `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file in example's folder and then build example or run development server as suggested above.
