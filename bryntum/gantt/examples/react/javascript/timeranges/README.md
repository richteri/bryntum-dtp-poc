## Time ranges React demo

This example show how to highlight important dates or time spans in the schedule in a React app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Bryntum Shared Library

This example uses BryntumGantt wrapper which is implemented in a shared library.
 
The library package is located in `examples/react/_shared` folder. 

This library is automatically installed and built during `npm install` for the example by `preinstall` script in `package.json` so it not required do it separately.    

To install and build it manually go to library folder and run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```
This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build example

To build example run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Troubleshooting

In the case of compile error (`npm run build` or `npm start` fails) try to delete `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file in example's folder and then build example or run development server as suggested above.
